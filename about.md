			<p>Tanya Scott is an Australian writer, doctor and educator. She is an accomplished survivor of near misses, including escaping from an engineering degree out of high school, crashing a car with a huntsman (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huntsman_spider">spider</a>) on her lap and getting caught in a rip while swimming off the Cocos Islands. She also managed to finish medical school with her sense of humour intact.</p>
			<p>Over a varied medical career, she has learned more from her patients than from any textbook â€“ not just about physical and mental health, but about humanity, resilience and the absurdity of life. While these themes inform her writing, her love of twisty mysteries has made her an accidental crime writer.</p>

			<p>After growing up on the coast in western Victoria, Tanya studied and worked in Melbourne for over a decade, but always knew the beach would claim her back. She is now based on Wadawurrung country, on the Victorian Surf Coast, with her family and pets. When not writing, she can be found with her head in a book or braving the wind at the beach. Stillwater is her first novel.</p>
