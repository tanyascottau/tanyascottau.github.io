		<h2 id="stillwater">Stillwater</h2>
		<p>When Jack Quinlan’s mother dies of a drug overdose,
		it’s not his father that raises him, but Gus—a
		ruthless crime boss who sees Jack for what he is:
		a whip-smart kid with untapped potential. It doesn’t
		take long for Gus to forge Jack into a weapon.
		But Jack was also self-aware enough to know where
		this sort of life was going to lead him. When the
		time was right, he got out. Or so he thought.
		<br>
		Seven years later, Jack is now Luke Harris, a regular
		guy putting himself through college and aiming for
		a real job and a real future. Falling in love. But
		Jack’s past isn’t so easily forgotten, and the
		bodies in his closet won’t forgive him.
		<br>
		When Luke’s newfound life collides with Gus’s
		underworld, survival becomes a deadly game. Luke
		must resurrect his dormant skills and confront the
		demons that threaten to consume him.</p>
