		<h2 id="stillwater">Stillwater</h2>
		<p>After years away from his hometown of Melbourne,
		Luke Harris is back on track. All he wants is a
		normal job, his own house and a dog.
		But Luke is a man with a past, where life was
		anything but peaceful and his skills ran to the
		dark side. A past not easily forgotten – or forgiven.
		<br>
		When he crosses paths with Gus Alberici – the brutal
		criminal he worked for as a teenager – he's dragged
		reluctantly back to his old life. Luke's father has
		vanished, along with a chunk of Gus's cash. And
		something is up with his new girlfriend's father ...
		<br>
		As his past and present collide, can Luke keep his
		long-held secrets – and outsmart a man who will
		stop at nothing to get what he wants?</p>
