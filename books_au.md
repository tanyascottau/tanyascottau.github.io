<h2 id="stillwater">Stillwater</h2>
<p>After years away from his hometown of Melbourne, Luke Harris is back on track. All he wants is a normal job, his own house and a dog.</p>
<p>But Luke is a man with a past, where life was anything but peaceful and his skills ran to the dark side. A past not easily forgotten – or forgiven.</p>
<p>When he crosses paths with Gus Alberici – the brutal criminal he worked for as a teenager – he's dragged reluctantly back to his old life. Luke's father has vanished, along with a chunk of Gus's cash. And something is up with his new girlfriend's father ...</p>
<p>As his past and present collide, can Luke keep his long-held secrets – and outsmart a man who will stop at nothing to get what he wants?</p>
